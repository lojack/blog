title: Getting started with Salt Stack
category: posts
---

The purpose of this evaluate and record salt stack for my current workflow. Right now we use chef/vagrant/rackspace for setting up both local and devlopment servers.

Getting started was easy, I simply visited the [Ubuntu Installation](http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/installation/ubuntu.html) guide and installed on both a master and minion host. Initially I will just set up one minion and attempt to get a single project loaded on the server the salt way.

On the client I type ```salt-minion -l debug``` because I'd like to see whats going on while I'm developing things. On the server its a matter of accepting the keys using ```salt-key -A```

A quick ```salt '*' test.ping``` reveals that my client has successfully connected. So far the syntax for running salt commands makes sense and getting started seems quite easy.

Next up, getting users added to the system. Up until this point I've been using root logins which is bad. My first step with any new system is to load a user that accepts ssh keys and has sudo access.

In ```/srv/salt/users.sls``` I add the following:

    zsh:
     pkg.installed
     
    rclark:
     user.present:
      - shell: /bin/zsh

Then run ```salt '*' state.sls users``` to keep the state up to date and run ```salt '*' user.list_users``` to verify that the user was added.
